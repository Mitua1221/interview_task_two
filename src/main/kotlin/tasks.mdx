# Welcome to the Interview

We’re excited to have you join us for this session! During the next 45 minutes, you will work on three small Kotlin development tasks designed to simulate real-world scenarios. You’re free to start with any task you prefer:

**⚠️ Please do not use LLM-based tools to solve these tasks, as their usage is very apparent in this setup.**

## Tasks

- **Task A**: Initials formatting.
- **Task B**: ViewModel's check.
- **Task D**: Currency quiz.
- **Task D**: Creating small tests.

## Session Duration

The session will automatically close after 45 minutes, so manage your time accordingly.

## Important Notes

- We can see your cursor and text selections in real-time as part of the collaborative environment.

/**
 * ## Task Description
 *
 * We need to retrieve a sum from our backend for a certain cryptocurrency.
 *
 * 1. We need to choose the data type that we will use in our application to receive this sum and work with it.
 *    We can choose absolutely any data type for this purposeâ€”`Double`, `Integer`, `Long`, `Float`, `String`, or any other.
 *
 * 2. After receiving the sum, we need to divide it by 13 and then multiply it by 5.
 *
 * 3. The resulting value must be rounded to 4 decimal places.
